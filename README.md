ðŸŽ§Mini-Project Update â€“ Spotify Page Clone with HTML & CSS ðŸŽ¨
I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve created a Spotify page clone using just HTML and CSS, without any frameworks or JavaScript!
This project helped me practice:
1. Structuring a layout using only <div> elements
2. Styling with Flexbox
3. Recreating modern UI designs
4. Improving consistency and spacing with CSS
Without using Grid or JavaScript, I was able to bring a sleek and responsive design to life. Itâ€™s been a fun and rewarding step in my front-end journey!
